Grunt was really awesome when it first came on the scene, but I've really come to love Gulp. It's faster, more flexible, and I find the "code-over-configuration" paradigm much easier to reason about—all with fewer lines of code.

I needed a boilerplate—suited to my tastes—that I could use to quickly get up and running on new projects with. If you're a fan of Angular, CoffeeScript, Jade, Sass, and TDD, then maybe you'll like it too!

I've just been bursting at the seams to post this good news. Today is my first day of work at [Chirp](http://uchirp.it), a social media startup based right here in Long Beach. The team is awesome, and I couldn't be more excited to learn and grow as a developer, working on something big in the process. Thank you guys for such an amazing opportunity, and thank you to my previous employer, [Gunn/Jerkens](http://gunnjerkens.com) & Epraxa, for a wonderful 6.5 years. Here's to the new road ahead!

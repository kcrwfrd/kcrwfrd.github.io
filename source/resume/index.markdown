## Objective
To work in a company with a product or engineering-driven culture, where passion makes the work fun.

## Experience

### [Shift.com](http://shift.com)
__Sr. Front-End Engineer__, September 2014 - Present
__Front-End Engineer__, March 2014 - September 2014

Shift provides enterprise-level marketing software for managing, analyzing, and optimizing advertising campaigns on social media.

Shortly after joining, I helped rewrite their flagship product, the Facebook Media Manager. The app is a "fat-client" SPA built on Angular, with our own backend middle layer, interfacing with the Facebook Ads API.

After its initial release, I took over as the project's front-end lead for its continued maintenance and development of new features. My role is to solve architectural challenges, oversee development by team members, and help develop the app by an agile and test-driven development methodology.

### Chirp
__UI Engineer__, October 2013 - February 2014

Chirp is a mobile social messaging app, and I was responsible for the development of its web interface. I built a Single Page Application on AngularJS, loosely coupled with a Node.js middle layer. All views, templating, and UI logic are solely the concern of the client-side AngularJS layer, and are automatically compiled with a Grunt-based build process. The Node.js layer is responsible for authentication and session management, and provides a RESTful JSON API that wraps a separate back-end API, which also serves the mobile client.

In addition, I developed a custom analytics dashboard for business intelligence purposes, using the Google Charts API.

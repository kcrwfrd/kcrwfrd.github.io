## Objective
To work with a talented team who challenges and inspires me to grow into an adept UX Engineer. I want to make peoples' lives easier, through code.


## Experience

### Gunn/Jerkens
__Lead Front-End Web Developer__, January 2012 - Present
__Front-End Web Developer__, June 2011 - December 2011

A typical project involves collaborating with graphic designers on UX and interaction design, and then following up with implementation. Collaboration with other developers is facilitated by Git and established deployment methodologies.

Everyday technology used includes PHP, HTML5, CSS3, SASS/Compass, Javascript, jQuery, Git, and (sigh) Wordpress.

#### Accomplishments
* Introduced and implemented open source software for the centralized processing and collection of user registrations
* Carried workload through severe resource shortage Fall 2012, never missing a deadline
* Designed and developed tools for the automation of project initialization
* Pitched and started product development initiatives
* Most proud of attracting and building a highly talented development team, early 2013

### Epraxa
__Sole Developer__, February 2009 - June 2011
__Jr. Front-End Web Developer__, June 2007 - February 2009

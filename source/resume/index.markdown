## Objective
To work with a talented team who challenges and inspires me to grow into an adept UX Engineer. I want to make peoples' lives easier, through code.

## Experience

### Chirp
__UI Engineer__, October 2013 - Present

Chirp is a mobile social messaging app, and I'm responsible for the development of its web interface. I built a Single Page Application on AngularJS, loosely coupled with a Node.js middle layer. All views, templating, and UI logic are solely the concern of the client-side AngularJS layer, and are automatically compiled with a Grunt-based build process. The Node.js layer is responsible for authentication and session management, and provides a RESTful JSON API that wraps a separate back-end API, which also serves the mobile client.

In addition, I developed a custom analytics dashboard for business intelligence purposes, using the Google Charts API.

### Gunn/Jerkens Marketing &amp; Communications
__Lead Front-End Web Developer__, January 2012 - October 2013
__Front-End Web Developer__, June 2011 - December 2011

My primary role at Gunn/Jerkens was to develop CMS-driven B2C brochure-type websites for our clients, typically from the homebuilding industry.

One of my most significant impacts, and easily my most rewarding, was building a development team from the ground up. By instilling a strong developer culture, I was able to build an exceptionally talented and productive team, ignited by the passion and intellectual curiosity of its members.

Together, we designed and developed tools for the automation of project boilerplate, shortening turn-around times and increasing profit margins. When a problem got tough, pair programming made quick work of it. We organized meetups, and pitched well-received product development initiatives company-wide.

Everyday technology used included PHP, HTML5, CSS3, SASS/Compass, Javascript, jQuery, and Git.

### Epraxa
__Front-End Web Developer__, February 2009 - June 2011
__Jr. Front-End Web Developer__, June 2007 - February 2009

At Epraxa, we subcontracted with ad agencies who lacked their own development teams, making B2C brochure-type websites principally for the homebuilding industry. From February 2009 onwards, I was the only developer on the team. In June 2011, we merged with our client, Gunn/Jerkens.

### Freelance
__Front-End Web Developer__, July 2006 - Spring 2009

Favorite project involved implementation of film asset tracking system for TakePart.com, Participant Media's social action network.

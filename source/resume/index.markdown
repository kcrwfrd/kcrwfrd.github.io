## Objective
To work with a talented team whose members challenge and inspire one another. I am passionate about both user and *developer* experience. I want to learn, grow, and make peoples' lives easier through code.

## Experience

### Shift
__Front-End Engineer__, March 2014 - Present

Shift provides enterprise-level marketing software for planning, optimizing and analyzing social advertising campaigns. As part of a team of client-side specialists, my role is to help develop and maintain applications built on AngularJS by an agile and test-driven development methodology.

### Chirp
__UI Engineer__, October 2013 - February 2014

Chirp is a mobile social messaging app, and I was responsible for the development of its web interface. I built a Single Page Application on AngularJS, loosely coupled with a Node.js middle layer. All views, templating, and UI logic are solely the concern of the client-side AngularJS layer, and are automatically compiled with a Grunt-based build process. The Node.js layer is responsible for authentication and session management, and provides a RESTful JSON API that wraps a separate back-end API, which also serves the mobile client.

In addition, I developed a custom analytics dashboard for business intelligence purposes, using the Google Charts API.

{% blockquote %}
I believe that when it comes to building software, the coding is the easy part. To ship a successful product, it really comes down to good teamwork. I always try to keep this in mind, and put an emphasis on being a good team player.

## Experience

### [Shift.com](http://shift.com)
__Front-End Engineer__, March 2014 - May 2015

Shift provides enterprise-level marketing software for managing, analyzing, and optimizing advertising campaigns on social media.

Shortly after joining, I helped rewrite their flagship product, the Facebook Media Manager (FMM). It is a "fat-client" single-page application built on Angular, with a Python-driven middle layer, interfacing with the Facebook Marketing API.

In the face of a sudden exodus of front-end talent, I took charge and successfully on-boarded a new team of re-assigned back-end engineers and new hires. At the time of my leaving, I was the only developer to have worked on the codebase from its beginning.

FMM would come to serve as a defining asset in consideration for Shift's $50M acquisition by [Brand Networks](https://bn.co/) in May, 2015.

### Chirp
__Software Engineer__, October 2013 - February 2014

Chirp was a mobile social messaging app, and I was responsible for the development of its web interface. I built a single-page application on AngularJS, loosely coupled with a Node.js middle layer that would serve to wrap—and eventually replace—a prototyped backend API with a new, RESTful API.

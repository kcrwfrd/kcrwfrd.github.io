I've been coding since I was a kid, when I learned to make websites for fun. I enjoyed the creativity, as well as the challenge. As a teen, I started freelancingâ€”and thus began my professional career.

Nowadays, I enjoy working in depth on the client-side, on complex data-driven Single Page Applications. I feel that it is the perfect marriage of my passions for UX and engineering.

I identify as a fully-native citizen of the web, having grown up immersed in computing since before I could read. It is this early start that I attribute to my intuitive grasp of user interfaces. On the computer, I'm at home.

I coded my first website at the age of 10, because I _really_ wanted to share my Starcraft strategies with whomever would listen. It's the exact same passion that drives me today in my career: I want to make something that not only makes me happy, but that others will find value in as well. I don't think there's anything else that could make a person more productive.

UX is my passion. I prefer implementation over design, though I certainly enjoy giving input during the design process. Still, I really appreciate working with a strong designer to help make everything truly beautiful.
